Reflection

When writing programs, I strive to make them maintainable, readable, and adaptable by focusing on modular design, clear naming conventions, and consistent documentation. In Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that separated each database operation into its own function. This structure made the code easy to test, update, and reuse, and it also allowed me to connect the module directly to the dashboard widgets in Project Two. Working in this way gave me the advantage of writing code once and then reusing it in multiple parts of the project, which saved time and reduced errors. I could also use this CRUD module in the future for other projects that require database interaction, since it was written to be general and flexible.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks and designing a solution that meets the client’s requirements. For this project, I first analyzed Grazioso Salvare’s needs and then planned the database operations and dashboard features step by step. This process was different from earlier assignments because it required me to think more about the user’s perspective and the practical use of the system, not just the technical requirements. Moving forward, I would continue to use strategies like incremental testing, modular programming, and close alignment with client needs when designing databases and dashboards for other projects.

Computer scientists solve problems by creating efficient, reliable, and user-focused solutions, and this work has a direct impact on organizations. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard I built enables the company to better organize and analyze animal data, which supports their mission of training rescue animals. By developing software that connects data to visualization tools, I can help organizations like this make faster and more informed decisions. This kind of work matters because it demonstrates how computer science can bridge the gap between raw data and real-world impact, ultimately helping companies achieve their goals more effectively.
